                                    <p>A friend of mine recommended me to register with Class construction internation Ltd as I had just started to look for job opportunities as my graduation was approaching. I had eight-years of study experience in Canada but not so much work experience.
Fortunately, Class construction internation Ltd offers a diverse range of job postings. After registration was completed, consultation was conducted to discuss my background and interests in career development. I always Recommend Class Construction International Ltd</p>

                                    <p>I was actively job searching on my own, without success. I Saw Class Construction International Ltd online and applied. I did an online interview with them and i was awarded the job. They took care of my documents and transportion, gave my family and I a place to settle in and i started working. They are very effective and they have no problem moving people to come work in canada. I have since made recommendations about Class Construction International Ltd services to associates who were looking for jobs.</p>

                                    <p>As a person with a disability, I was struggling connecting with employers. I registered with Class Construction International Ltd Capability Program and attended four weeks of Enhanced Employment Assistance Services and completed a 12-week work placement in a related industry. Class Construction International Ltd staff made a difference because of their expertise in pre-employment skills (resume, cover letter, interviews, workplace expectations, etc.), and their employer network, connections, and negotiations on my behalf.</p>

I got a part time job as a painting assistant for about 2years and after i was done with school i got hired with a good salary, the working condition is good and the benefits are outstanding.</p>
